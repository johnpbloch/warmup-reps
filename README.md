# WarmupReps

This application is a warmup sets and reps calculator for various
strength training programs.  You choose your working weight for each 
exercise in the program and the warmup sets and reps are automatically
calculated, along with the weights you need to place on the bar.  As 
you use it, it remembers preferences such as bar size, unit system, 
and the weights for each exercise when you come back for the next 
workout.  

## Programs

Programs are defined in JSON and placed in the programs folder.  An 
example program:

    {
      "title" : "My Program",
      "exercises" : [{
        "name" : "Squats",
        "max" : 500,
        "workouts" : [{
            "sets" : "2",
            "reps" : "5",
            "multiplier" : 0.5
          }, {
            "sets" : "1",
            "reps" : "5",
            "multiplier" : 1.0
          }
        ]
      }]
    }

Each exercise is defined with a name, a max weight, and an array of 
workouts that include sets, reps, and the multiplier for the working
weight.  For a more complete example, view starting_strength.json in the
programs folder.
